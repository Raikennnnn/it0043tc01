                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                After months of intense training, dedication, and perseverance, I am thrilled to share that I have finally hit my personal record (PR) in deadlifting 150kg. This journey has been filled with highs and lows, but the sense of accomplishment I feel now makes it all worth it.

                <strong>The Journey</strong><br>
                Achieving this milestone wasn't easy. It required consistent effort, proper nutrition, and a well-structured workout plan. Here's a glimpse into the steps I took to reach this goal:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setting a Goal:</strong> It all started with setting a clear, achievable goal. I knew I wanted to deadlift 150kg, and I set smaller milestones to track my progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Program:</strong> I followed a structured training program that focused on building strength and improving my deadlift form. This included variations of deadlifts, accessory exercises, and incorporating rest days for recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition and Recovery:</strong> Proper nutrition played a crucial role in my journey. I focused on a balanced diet with adequate protein intake to support muscle growth and recovery. Additionally, I made sure to get enough sleep and rest to allow my body to recover.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Toughness:</strong> Staying motivated and mentally strong was key. There were days when I felt like giving up, but I reminded myself of my goal and kept pushing forward.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>The Big Day</strong><br>
                On the day I attempted my PR, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. After a thorough warm-up, I loaded the barbell with 150kg. With every ounce of strength and determination, I approached the bar, took a deep breath, and executed the lift. The feeling of successfully lifting the weight was indescribable. It was a moment of pure triumph and joy.
            </p>
